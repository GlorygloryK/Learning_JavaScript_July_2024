// To export the previous function called sayHello, I write this code:
const sayHello = require('./04_exporting_function_example2');

// console.log(sayHello("Glory"));

// Means that when i run this file (on my CLI : node 05_importing_function_example2.js)
// Whatever I had in the imported file is ALL run in this (i.e. the exported) file too
